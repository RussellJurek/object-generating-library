{"name":"Object-generating-library","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/object-generating-library","body":"A C++ library that stitches together pixels/voxels in 2D/3D images to create a catalog of objects. This library was developed for 2D/3D astronomical images (fits files), but the library functions are independent of file type. This library is implemented in C++11. It relies on C++11 to create catalogs of arbitrary size (subject to vector limits).\r\n\r\nThis library defines a class, obj_props, and a double precision variant, obj_props_dbl. This library is designed to quickly combine pixels/voxels to create a catalog of either obj_props or obj_props_dbl objects.\r\n\r\nThis C++ library implements the algorithm described in Jurek (2012), 'The Characterised Noise HI Source Finder: Detecting HI Galaxies Using a Novel Implementation of Matched Filtering'. This is an extension of Lutz 1 Pass algorithm. It is based upon a novel sparse representation of 3D binary data, which routinely achieves 90%+ compression rates. Both this algorithm and the sparse representation are described in Jurek (2012). Jurek (2012) can be found at http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASA...29..251J . Please cite this paper if you use this library, algorithm or sparse representation.\r\n\r\nThis library's extended functionality requires valid CFITSIO, PGPLOT and WCSLIB installations. The basic functionality however is completely independent of all three.","google":"UA-46463815-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
